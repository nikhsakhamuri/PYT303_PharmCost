# Rubric and Requirements 

<b>This information was downloaded from the course modules.</b>

(DUE: December 4th, 2022)

As part of this course, students will work in groups of 2-4 (groups will be assigned by the instructor) to complete a data analysis project. The project will be opened during Week 2 and due at the end of Week 5 
Objective
The objective of this project is for students to get hands-on experience working on robust data analysis projects with the goal of recommending actionable insights using data from a domain they are interested in. These projects are also meant to serve as a peer-reviewed addition to students' coding portfolios so they can walk away from this course with a GitHub-worthy example of their python knowledge (or at least something to talk about in a future interview!)
Project Requirements 

# One python notebook should be submitted.
Each project should have the following sections:
  Introduction/ Objective of the project and script (Markdown) (10/31-11/6)
  Data Exploration & Cleaning (Markdown and Code) (Week 2) (11/7-11/13)
  Data Analysis (Markdown and Code) (Week 3 + Week 5)* (11/14-11/20) (11/21-11/27) (11/28-12/4)
  Data Visualizations (Markdown and Code) (Week 4)* (11/21-11/27) 
  Recommendations (Markdown)

# Grading Rubric
Everyone in a group will receive the same grade. The group project is worth 100 points (compared to a weekly assignment which is worth 20). 
However, the group assignment is not meant to be 5x the work of an individual assignment for each group member. 
Instead, the higher points are meant to reflect the weekly effort this assignment will require as students go through the different modules and build on their python skills.
This project should be worked on throughout the course as you learn the material -- do not wait until week 5 to get started.


Introduction
Full points are awarded for a straightforward introduction including the objective of the report/script and any domain-specific hypotheses your team has going into the analysis. 
10%
Data Exploration
Full points for robust exploration of the data used to explore any nuances or limitations within the data source. 
15%
Data Analysis
Full points for an appropriately executed regression with the interpretation of the output in the context of the objective. This step should also include any needed data cleaning.
20%
Data Visualization
Full points for at least two appropriate visualizations of your group's data. Visualizations must provide some value to the analysis and be well-labeled. 
15%
Recommendation
Full points for clear and actionable takeaway from the analysis. Data analysis is as much about how to code as it is about how to use code as a tool to extract insights. 
20%
Readability / Story Telling
Full points for appropriate documentation throughout the report that speaks to the intended logic behind the code. In addition, the notebook must clarify where each section begins and how each section ties into the objective and final recommendations.
